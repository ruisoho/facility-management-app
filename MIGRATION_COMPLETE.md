# MongoDB to SQLite Migration - COMPLETE ✅

## Migration Summary

The Facility Management App has been successfully migrated from MongoDB to SQLite. All data models, routes, and functionality have been converted to use SQLite exclusively.

## What Was Migrated

### 1. Database Schema
- **SQLite Database**: `/server/database/sqlite.js`
- **Tables Created**:
  - `consumption` - Energy consumption records with electricity, gas, weather data
  - `tasks` - Task management with full workflow support
  - `maintenance` - Maintenance scheduling and tracking
  - `attachments` - File uploads for tasks and maintenance
  - `facilities` - Facility information (already existed)
  - `electric_meters` - Electric meter readings (already existed)
  - `daily_readings` - Daily meter readings (already existed)

### 2. Routes Converted
- **Consumption Routes**: `/server/routes/consumption.js` (SQLite-based)
- **Tasks Routes**: `/server/routes/tasks.js` (SQLite-based)
- **Maintenance Routes**: `/server/routes/maintenance.js` (SQLite-based)
- **Upload Routes**: `/server/routes/upload.js` (SQLite-based with attachments table)

### 3. Models Removed
- ❌ `Consumption.js` (MongoDB model)
- ❌ `Task.js` (MongoDB model)
- ❌ `Maintenance.js` (MongoDB model)

### 4. Backup Files Created
- `consumption-mongodb-backup.js`
- `upload-mongodb-backup.js`

## Key Features Maintained

### Consumption Management
- ✅ CRUD operations for consumption records
- ✅ Analytics and statistics
- ✅ Chart data generation
- ✅ Verification system
- ✅ Monthly comparisons and trends

### Task Management
- ✅ Complete task lifecycle (create, update, complete, delete)
- ✅ Priority and status management
- ✅ Deadline tracking and overdue detection
- ✅ File attachments support
- ✅ Recurring tasks
- ✅ Dashboard statistics

### Maintenance Management
- ✅ Maintenance scheduling and tracking
- ✅ System type categorization
- ✅ Company and technician information
- ✅ Equipment details and warranty tracking
- ✅ File attachments support
- ✅ Completion workflow
- ✅ Overdue and upcoming maintenance alerts

### File Upload System
- ✅ Multi-file uploads for tasks and maintenance
- ✅ File metadata storage in attachments table
- ✅ Download and deletion functionality
- ✅ File type validation and size limits
- ✅ Upload statistics and analytics

## API Compatibility

All existing API endpoints remain the same:
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/consumption`
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/tasks`
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/maintenance`
- `POST /api/upload/task/:taskId`
- `POST /api/upload/maintenance/:maintenanceId`

## Database Benefits

### Performance
- ✅ Faster queries with SQLite
- ✅ No network latency
- ✅ Embedded database

### Simplicity
- ✅ No external database server required
- ✅ Single file database
- ✅ Easy backup and restore

### Development
- ✅ Simplified deployment
- ✅ No MongoDB connection issues
- ✅ Better error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Application**: Verify all functionality works correctly
2. **Data Migration**: If you have existing MongoDB data, you'll need to export and import it
3. **Remove MongoDB Dependencies**: Clean up any remaining MongoDB packages if not needed elsewhere
4. **Update Documentation**: Update any API documentation to reflect the changes
